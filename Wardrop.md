#Wardrop Response

The top-down method mentioned is the article is when researchers take a spatially large continuous dataset and disagregate it into smaller sections
based on the functional relationship between the spatial location and the data set. An example of this is Gridded Popultaion of the World.
Here, they combined census population counts with a grid cells of the same area and to create a proportional representation of the world's
population distribution. This technique produces very detailed spatial representaitons of data, although to do this the data used must be
accurate and reliable, which is hard to find in developing countries. 

The bottom-up methods works the opposite way and is favorable in situations where accurate country wide data is unavailable. Bottom-up
uses small, discrete pieces of spatial data, such as microcensus surveys, and uses the relationship between the data and spatial location to
extract information about the surrounding area. This is done using covariates, variables that influence the one being studied. To
continue the population example, a covariate of population density would be land use. Or a covariate of poverty would be the absence of house
lights. This type of processing is used to estimate a variable acorss an area, not try to explain it, and it succeeds at this goal. Bottom-up
uses multiple sources of data to create as accurate of a representation as possible.

These are both very effective methods and produce accurate depictions of a variable, such as population, in the absense of complete data.
Bottom-up processing especially, is especially helpful in developing countries, or countries experiencing turmoil, where large scale datasets
are hard to find.
