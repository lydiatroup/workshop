# Political Subdivisions: Mexico
Mexico has three administrative levels, ADM0, ADM1, and ADM2. ADM0 is the country's international border, ADM1 consists of States, which are further broken down into municipalities (ADM2s). This project focuses on the ADM1 of Yucatan located in the Yucatan Penninsula in the Gulf of Mexico, and later zooms into the Tizimin and Merida Municipalities, located in Yucatan.

The map above shows Mexico and it's administrative regions. The first administrative region, states, are shown by the thicker green/blue lines. On the northern most part of the penninsula is the Yucatan state, which is focused on in the rest of the region. The fainter blue/purple lines divide the states into municipalities.

The above map shows the municipalities located in the Mexican state of Yucatan. The two highlighted regions, Tizimin and Merida, are focused on in the remainder of this project. Merida has the highest population of any Yucatan municipality with a population of 1,142,000 in 2019. Tizimin has the second highest population at 46,000 in 2010.
 
# Yucatan Population Predictions

  To predict population in Yucatan Mexico, a model was created utilizing landcover and land use data, along with nighttime lights, slope, and topography. The population prediction is for 2015, when the aformentioned data is from, while the actual population values being compared are from 2019. To create these plots, population and covariate data were downloaded from worldpop.
  
  
# Tizimin Urban Areas, Roads, and Access to Healthcare Facilities
  
  Healthcare facility and road data were downloaded from HDX, and population data used to determine urban areas is from worldpop.
