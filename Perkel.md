notes from reading
there are alternatives to traditional GIS packages, these alternatives generally rely more on coding (R and python) and are more open source
Qgis, although free and good functionality, is harder to learn than esri products
    also has plug ins for more advanced tasks ( classifying land coverage, measuring slope, calculating travel times, modelling path of flowing water) altho some of those can be done in esri products
issues with projections = misaligned data
vector = points, lines, polygons. raster = continuous data (changes in elevation or rainfall)
people are creating online encyclopedias for geological data involving mapping 
  shanan peters & Macrostat
Nistara randhawa -> used arcgis to model roads and population centers, then R to model an influenza outbreak in Rwanda
  arc gis messed up as network locations increased, used GrassGIS to use text based instructions instead of map based
    arc gis and qgis use python
    
coding > gis
 can use most up to date algorithms
 foster reproducability (can repeat runs specifying what version of code to use)
